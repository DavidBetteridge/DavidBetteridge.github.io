	<h2>Side Projects</h2>
	I'm currently working on a mini blog series about using async/await in C#. I'm hoping to understand and cover the
	following points
	<ul>
		<li>The basics of calling asynchronous methods.</li>
		<li>How to correctly call asynchronous methods.</li>
		<li>Using them within the <b>await</b> keyword.</li>
		<li>What does the magic <b>await</b> keyword actually do.</li>
		<li>The maths behind composing tasks together</li>
	</ul>
	Still very much a work in progress, but there are the beginnings of some articles there for you to read.  Please let me know if I've completely misunderstood any topics!

	<h2>Running</h2>
	My next race is the Hardmoors 110 in May, need to do some training....

	<h2>Real Work - Proactis</h2>
	Currently working as the Technical Lead on the exciting <a href="https://www.proactis.com/uk/solutions/rethink-spend/spend-control/accelerated-payment-facility/">BePayd</a> project - this should have a big positive impact on the company.
	
	<h2>York Developers</h2>
	For the next York Code Dojo (in April) we will be looking at WebAssembly
